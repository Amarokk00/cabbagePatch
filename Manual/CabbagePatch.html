                <h2>On the Subject of Cabbage Patch</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.</p>
                <p>In this module, you will be prompted with a patch of dirt that can contain up to 9 crops. 
                    With the information present on this bomb found out which crops are present with the help of table 1. 
                    Each crop will need to be watered at a specific time given by table 2. 
                    Some plants might need to be removed using a shovel.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a specific plant you should pay attention to, and it is the evil cabbage. 
                        When an evil cabbage is present, it will always be in the middle of the patch. 
                        So when you go through table 1, ignore the middle area since it’s already occupied.</li>
                    <li>Starting with the top left of the patch, go through each statement in table 1. 
                        The first correct statement will correspond to which crop is in this area, 
                        then go to the second area of the patch and keep going through the table until all nine areas are filled.</li>
                    <li>If you went through all of the table and are still missing some areas, then from the bottom of the table go up through each statement but with their opposite meaning.</li>
                    <li>You might encounter weeds, they need to be removed with the shovel, then take the next correct statement as the crop for this area.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to water all other plants once before watering a second time and so on.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This module is solved when all crops have been watered enough and are ready to be collected.</p>
